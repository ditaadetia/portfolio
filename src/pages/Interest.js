          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber.
          During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking,
          free climbing, and kayaking.

          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a
          large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy
          advancements in the front-end web development world.
